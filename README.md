# Dice Game with Pygame

This project is a simple dice game implemented using Pygame, a Python library for creating games and multimedia applications. In this game, players can simulate a cricket match where they can either bat or ball against the computer.

## Features

- **Toss:** Players can toss a virtual coin to determine who bats or bowls first.
- **Batting:** Players can choose to bat first and score runs while avoiding getting out.
- **Bowling:** Players can choose to bowl first and try to restrict the opponent's runs while aiming to take wickets.
- **Computer Opponent:** The computer acts as the opponent, making its decisions based on random selections.
- **Score Tracking:** The game keeps track of runs scored by both players, allowing for a competitive match.
- **Visual Feedback:** The game provides visual feedback through images and text to indicate game events and outcomes.
